- Switch to pure tools.build

- with-require - if namespace exists, requires it, and runs code with the wanted vars from it.
    (with-require [[clojure.tools.logging :as log]]
      (log/info "Log something"))
    - Might not be needed in Clojure 1.12.

- Run CI tests on ClojureCLR too?
- queue and queue? (like in Medley)
