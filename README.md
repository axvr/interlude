# Refrain

Collection of small, but useful Clojure utilities I've created that
I frequently find myself replicating across programs.

Essentially this is my own personal version of [medley](https://github.com/weavejester/medley),
but it can work along-side it or instead of it.


## Installation

> **Warning**
> Refrain is still a work-in-progress.  Until it reaches v1.0, expect backwards
