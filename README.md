# Refrain

Collection of small, but useful Clojure utilities I've created that
I frequently find myself replicating across programs.

Essentially this is my own personal version of [Medley](https://github.com/weavejester/medley),
however they can work along-side each other.


## Installation

> **Warning**
> Refrain is still a work-in-progress.  Until it reaches v1.0, expect backwards
> incompatible changes.

Add the following to your `deps.edn` file:

```clojure
{:deps {uk.axvr/refrain
         {:git/sha "82b6e15db29b35275d6c8a98053cf16d540291c1"
          :git/url "https://github.com/axvr/refrain.git"}}}
```
